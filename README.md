## Notes

### When Cloning
You have a theme you added as a git submodule and you recently re-cloned your project. Guess what? Your submodule needs to be re-downloaded as well. 

`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

### Raw HTML shortcode 

I'm interested to follow [this tutorial](https://anaulin.org/blog/hugo-raw-html-shortcode/) using a shortcode for injecting raw HTML into a markdown file.
